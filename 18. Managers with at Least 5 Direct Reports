Question
The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|Id    |Name 	  |Department |ManagerId |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
|101   |John 	  |A 	      |null      |
|102   |Dan 	  |A 	      |101       |
|103   |James 	  |A 	      |101       |
|104   |Amy 	  |A 	      |101       |
|105   |Anne 	  |A 	      |101       |
|106   |Ron 	  |B 	      |101       |
+------+----------+-----------+----------+
Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
Note:
No one would report to himself.

Creating the Schema
use leetcode;

drop table if exists employee;
Create table If Not Exists Employee (
     Id int, 
     Name varchar(255), 
     Department varchar(255), 
     ManagerId int);

Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
     values ('101', 'John', 'A', null);
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
     values ('102', 'Dan', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
     values ('103', 'James', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
     values ('104', 'Amy', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) 
     values ('105', 'Anne', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId)
     values ('106', 'Ron', 'B', '101');
